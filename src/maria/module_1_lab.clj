;; after completing module 1 as a walk-through they should be
;; presented with a "problem" or creative task (ugh that word) that
;; involves free creation using the tools they've been shown, plus
;; coaching

;; they should know:
;; strings, true/false, numbers, functions, first/rest/last, conj, equality,
;; TODO complete list

;; TODO let them pick from at least 3-5 creative projects they could build/explore
;; - introduce drawing fns and let them play with LEGOs
;; - word puzzle (re-implement `subs`?)
;; - tell an emoji story / make an emoji world on screen
;; - mathy/CS stuff
