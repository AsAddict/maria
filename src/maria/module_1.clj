;; Hi. Those two semicolons to my left mean I'm a comment--I don't
;; evaluate to anything. In Clojure, everything that's not a comment
;; evaluates to something.

"duck"

;; Put your cursor to the right of "duck", after the quotation
;; mark. Press `command-enter`. Bam. You just evaluated a duck.

;; Our duck evaluation (which is also "duck") appeared in the output
;; panel on the right. That's how we're going to work: type and
;; evaluate code on the left; output displays on the right.

;; We call "duck" an `expression`. What happened when you pressed
;; `command-enter` was that Clojure, the programming language,
;; returned to you the `value` that the expression `evaluates` to. In
;; this case, "duck" evaluates to "duck".

;; What else can we evaluate? Well, Clojure can help us draw.

(circle 20)

;; Clojure evaluated a circle for us. This time, our expression calls
;; a function. To call a function, we create a pair of
;; parenteses--`()`--and put the function name inside, followed by all
;; the expressions we want to give to the function (the
;; "parameters"). Here, `circle` is the function we call, and we give
;; it a radius parameter of `20`.

;; XXX we need arglists hints so I can explain them here

;; How do you think you could make that circle bigger? Type your code
;; in where we put the ellipsis `...`. XXX Remember to check the arg
;; list.

...

;; What do you think happens if you give `circle` too many parameters?
;; Let's try:

(circle 20 20)

;; If we write code that Clojure can't understand, it will tell us it
;; can't run it. If it can, Clojure will try to tell you how to fix
;; your code.

;; What do you think this next expression will draw?

(colorize "blue" (circle 20))

;; We colorized our circle by passing it to another function. Notice
;; how the `circle` function is nested inside the `colorize` function?

;; Let's draw a bunch of shapes side-by-side using the `line-up` function:

(line-up (circle 25)
         (rectangle 50 50)
         (circle 25)
         (rectangle 50 50)
         (circle 25)
         (rectangle 50 50)
         (circle 25)
         (rectangle 50 50)
         (circle 25)
         (rectangle 50 50))

;; Man, that was a lot of typing. And so repetitive! When I see myself
;; repeating the same code over and over, I get suspicious.

;; Luckily, we can code ourselves a shorter solution. We don't have to
;; type `(rectangle 50 50)` and `(circle 25)` over and over. We can
;; type it once and Clojure will remember it for us:

(let [c (circle 25) ;; XXX just one pair at first?
      r (rectangle 50 50)] 
  ;; Now we can type just `c` and `r`:
  (line-up c r c r c r c r c r))

;; We used `let` to define names (`c` and `r`) for our
;; expressions. The `let` function's first parameter is a pair of
;; square brackets (`[]`) with pairs of names and values inside.

;; Can you make all the circles one color, and the squares another?

...

;; OK. Let's say we wanted to draw a checkerboard: a big square made
;; up of lots of little squares, alternating colors. Let's start with
;; our smallest unit: a single square.

(square 5) ;; ERROR

;; Oops. Clojure doesn't know squares--only rectangles.

(rectangle 25 25)

;; We can make a 2x2 checker for our building block.

(let [r (colorize "red" (rectangle 25 25))
      b (colorize "black" (rectangle 25 25))]
  (stack (line-up r b)
         (line-up b r)))

;; OK, now let's repeat that checker until it forms a row.

(let [r (colorize "red" (rectangle 25 25))
      b (colorize "black" (rectangle 25 25))
      checker (stack (line-up r b)
                     (line-up b r))]
  (apply line-up (repeat 4 checker)))

;; ...and we repeat the rows to make a complete board.

(let [r (colorize "red" (rectangle 25 25))
      b (colorize "black" (rectangle 25 25))
      checker (stack (line-up r b)
                     (line-up b r)) 
      row (apply line-up (repeat 4 checker))]
  (stack (repeat 4 row)))


;; XXX Man, that was a lot of typing. I hate typing. Luckily, we can code
;; ourselves a shorter solution. We don't have to type `(rectangle 25
;; 25)` over and over. We can type it once and Clojure will remember
;; it for us:





;; XXX should we do something else before immediately showing `def`?
(def r (rectangle 25 25))

;; We just told Clojure to "define" the letter r as the expression `(rectangle 25 25)` for later. That lets us say:

(line-up (rectangle 25 25) (rectangle 25 25) (rectangle 25 25) (rectangle 25 25))

;; ...as

(line-up r r r r)

;; But we still want a SQUARE, don't we? Why do you make us write `25`
;; twice every time we call `rectangle`, Clojure? I thought you were
;; my friend, Clojure. Couldn't you give us a `square` function?

;; Clojure feels bad that it didn't give you a `square` function. But
;; Clojure has an idea. You're a programmer now, and Clojure is here
;; to help you. You and Clojure can MAKE a `square` function:

(def square (fn [side] (rectangle side side)))

;; Once we evaluate that, we can `(square 5)` as often as we please:

(square 5)

(square 5)

(square 5)

(square 5)

;; Awesome. How did we do that?

;; We defined `square` with the `def` function:
(doc def)







;;;; XXX transition
;; Why? Have no fear. Clojure will tell us what "duck" is. Clojure is
;; helpful. Clojure is your friend.

;; We ask Clojure questions like this. Go ahead, evaluate it. (Put
;; your cursor at the end of the line and press `command-enter`.)

(what-is "duck")

;; Wait--what did we just evaluate?

(what-is what-is)

;; We just asked Clojure a question by evaluating a function. to call
;; a function, we write the function name and then the expressions we
;; want to pass to the function (the "arguments" or "parameters"), and
;; we wrap the whole thing up nice and tidy with parentheses.

;; so, when we write `(what-is "duck")` we're telling Clojure:
;;  1. we're calling a function (because we're using parentheses)
;;  2. the question (function) we're asking Clojure is `what-is` (because it goes first)
;;  3. we're asking `what-is` on the expression `"duck"`

;; Let's ask Clojure some other questions. 

(first "duck")

;; Weird. What is that? --wait! You know how to ask Clojure what a thing is. Go ahead. 

(what-is (first "duck"))

;; Woohoo! So the first thing in "duck" is a character. And that `first` thing--what's that? Before evaluating anything, what do YOU think `first` is?

;; ok, now ask Clojure:
(what-is first)

;; So we know `first` is a function. But what does it do? When we want
;; to learn what's inside an expression, usually we evaluate it, or
;; use `first` and similar functions (which we'll explore later). When
;; we want to learn what's inside a function, we use `doc`:

(doc what-is)

(doc doc)

(doc first)

;; XXX need jump to definition
;; XXX need to see arglist
;; XXX need to finish explanation of both of those as part of examining the innards of functions

;; Functions are usually questions, but they can also be
;; orders. Clojure will do stuff for us, if we ask nicely. Clojure
;; doesn't want "please" and "thank you", though. It just wants
;; parentheses.











;; (XXX either transition or culling needed--this was snipped from `what-is` intro)
;; what does Clojure give us back? 

(what-is (what-is "duck"))  ;; (have them eval both inner and outer form)

;; we gave a function a string, and it returned a string.

;; --> a string is a "string" of characters (letters)















;; anyway, back to our duck.

"duck"

;; before moving to the next bit, try to answer these questions in your own words. they're not trick questions, it's just looking back at what you've already evaluated above.
;; what do we know about "duck"? (...it's a string, strings are made up of characters)
;; what can we do with "duck"? (...pass it to functions, examine it)

;; lots of things can be characters, and therefore strings. before evaluating, make a guess for what you think Clojure will tell you when you evaluate this expression.

"æ¼¢å­—"

;; and what do you think will Clojure say when you evaluate this?
(what-is "æ¼¢å­—")

;; and this?
(first "æ¼¢å­—")

;; and this?
(what-is (first "æ¼¢å­—"))

;; or what about this?
(what-is "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–")

(comment ;; XXX is this section possible with emoji?
  (what-is (first "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–")) ;; XXX eval'ing inner form may not return prettily; if so then nix this

  ;; great. you and Clojure are working together great. Clojure is your little helper. You and Clojure are going to do great things together.

  ;; we asked `first` of "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–" -- what if we want to ask about the ðŸ’¥ or ðŸ’– in "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–" ? how do you guess we could get to those characters in our string?

  ;; to get ðŸ’¥  from "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–" ?
  ...

  ;; to get ðŸ’– from "ðŸ˜€ðŸ’¥âœ¨ðŸ’–" ?
  ...
  )

;; XXX (these are very leading questions--which might be unavoidable at this stage. but generally one wants to avoid asking questions for which there is only one answer available for the student to guess)

;; (maybe then show the general case with `nth`? that could also be stultifying)

;; --------------
;; XXX (possible exercise that might be too open-ended)
;; what makes a string a string? try to create a string that the computer will recognize. (replace the ellipsis with your string)

...

;; and how would you check if your string is a string? (replace the ellipsis with how you'd ask)

...

;; so a string is "characters" that go between double quotes. let's push those boundaries. is there anyhing you could put between two double quotes that wouldn't make a string? try to break strings. brainstorm with your partner. try to confuse the computer.

;; FIXME TODO (introduce example that lends itself to (let) -- doing multiple things? doing a single thing after building "state", like a poor man's threading?)
;; (the bindings vector is OK to use for a short while before formally introducing vectors, because it's just The Way Things Are Done...and then we introduce vectors by reminding them they already know it.)





;; (transition to new example--string, number, vector, whatever. maybe something intentionally unwieldy.)

;; let's pretend we're the red cross, and we need to get supplies to some refugee camps
"38.4225Â° N, 27.1438Â° E"
"37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
"36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"

;; ok, but that's three separate strings. In Clojure, we do that like this:

["38.4225Â° N, 27.1438Â° E"
 "37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
 "36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"]

;; what is that? ask the computer.

...

;; vectors are a(n indexed) collection of values. the same functions we used with strings work here:

(first ["38.4225Â° N, 27.1438Â° E"
        "37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
        "36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"])

(second ["38.4225Â° N, 27.1438Â° E"
         "37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
         "36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"])

       "37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
       "36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"])

abc
;; man, it's annoying to keep copying that whole vector around. couldn't we--

(def camps ["38.4225Â° N, 27.1438Â° E"
            "37.0099Â° N, 37.7969Â° E"
            "36.6463Â° N, 37.0825Â° E"])

;;;; transition to inspecting vectors (maybe we introduced them as a
;;;; data type already) while holding on to the thread of asking
;;;; Clojure, our dear colleague, questions (via functions)

["crawl" "walk" "run"]

(first ["crawl" "walk" "run"])

(rest ["crawl" "walk" "run"])

(second ["crawl" "walk" "run"]) ;; (this...

(last ["crawl" "walk" "run"])

(nth ["crawl" "walk" "run"] 0) ;; ...and this make me think the example should be >3 elements)

(count ["crawl" "walk" "run"]) ;; (this is probably overkill; don't try give them all the tools at once)

;; (or apply those functions to some other vector that's representative, interesting, and not boring)

["pants" "socks" "shoes" "coat" "backpack"] ;; pants are so andronormative

["pick apples" "wash apples" "chop apples" "bake apple pie"] ;; so ethnocentric, you American

["sign up for ClojureBridge" "have a lovely time talking to Clojure" "build awesome things with Clojure"]

;; (regardless of which vector we explore, we want to introduce
;; functions, vectors, and inspecting things)

;;;; (introduce `doc`)

(doc first)

(doc last) ;; etc.

;;;; (I'd like to introduce `def` soon, and let them create their own
;;;; functions, but ideally I want to present them with a *PROBLEM* or
;;;; *QUESTION* that def'ing and functions solve.)

(def my-pet "Deutscher SchÃ¤ferhund") ;; XXX this example is dry; could use some outside perspective

my-pet

(= my-pet "Deutscher SchÃ¤ferhund")

;; (maybe run off with the `pet` idea a bit? so we can explore/introduce other ideas)
(conj [my-pet] "chihuahua")

my-pet ;; still just the Schaferhund

;;;; (more here)

;;;; (transition)

;;;; (introduce fn)

(fn [x] (inc x)) ;; this is so boring I'm in tears, please add emoji or SOMETHING
