;;;; Asking the Computer Questions

;; Put your cursor at the end of the line with "puppy" and press
;; `control-enter` (`command-enter` on Mac):

"puppy"

;; You just evaluated a puppy! üê∂

;; Clojure is a language full of things called expressions, and this
;; is one. All expressions can be evaluated, as you just did with this
;; one. What kind of expression is "puppy"? Evaluate this expression
;; to find out:

(what-is "puppy")

;; Ok! It's a _string_, which is a funny way of saying "some
;; text". There are several other kinds of things in Clojure that
;; we'll get to know later, but in the meantime let's talk about those
;; parenthesis.

;; Whenever you see an expression in parentheses, it's kind of like a
;; sentence where the first thing after the `(` is treated as the
;; verb. We call these verbs "functions", and when we evaluate a form
;; in parens it _calls_ the function at the beginning of the
;; expression on the _arguments_ that follow.

;; What do you think a `circle` function might do?

(circle 50)

;; Here, we're calling the `circle` function on the number 50. And look!
;; Now we have a circle with a 50-pixel radius.

;; We can examine all the different pieces of that expression with `what-is`:

(what-is 50)

(what-is circle)

;; We can even apply the `what-is` function to the `what-is` function
;; itself to find out what `what-is` is! üòπ

(what-is what-is)

;;;; Asking the computer to do things

;; A moment ago we made a circle with the expression `(circle
;; 50)`. Try creating your own expression to use some other numbers
;; with `circle`.

;; vvv your code goes here üòÄ

;; ^^^ your code goes here

;; What if we hadn't already known that `circle` needed to be given a
;; radius? How would we find out the parameters to a function? Why, we
;; can ask our friend the computer!

(doc circle)

;; The `doc` function is short for "documentation". It tells us what a
;; function does and what parameters it needs. We gave `doc` the
;; parameter `circle`, so it gives us documentation for the `circle`
;; function. The computer wants to help us.

;; TODO (once we have nice results) try and fail (doc "puppy")

;; Try giving circle the wrong number of parameters, just to see what
;; happens:

(circle 20 10)

;; We got an error! Don't worry if you create errors. It happens to
;; everyone. When we write code that Clojure can't understand, it will
;; tell us. It will even try to say how to fix our code.


;;;; Shapes and Colors

;; As you might guess, there's a `rectangle` function much like
;; `circle`. Let's find out how it works:

(doc rectangle)

;; OK, so it takes two parameters: width and height. Let's take it for
;; a spin.

(rectangle 200 50)

;; Well, that's not too surprising. These one-tone shapes are a little
;; boring. Let's add some color!

(colorize "blue" (rectangle 250 100))

;; You can nest expressions inside other expressions to create bigger
;; ones. Try putting your cursor after the `rectangle` expression, but
;; before the last `)`, and then use your powers of evaluation.

(colorize "blue" (rectangle 250 (* 2 50)))

;; Try evaluating each of these sub-expressions, starting from the
;; numbers, one at a time from the inside out. Do you now know what
;; `*` does?

;; Maybe, if you feel like it, change "blue" to "purple" or another
;; color too.

;; We can also combine several expressions to create a `stack` of
;; shapes:

(stack (colorize "red" (circle 25))
       (colorize "blue" (rectangle 50 50)))

;; or line them up side by side `line-up`:

(line-up (colorize "red" (circle 25))
         (colorize "blue" (rectangle 50 50))
         (colorize "green" (circle 25)))

;; Wow--that is a lot of nested expressions. Why not try evaluating
;; each of these sub-expressions too?

;; OK, now that you are experienced with evaluating individual
;; expressions inside a big nested expression, let's combine `stack`
;; and `line-up`:

(stack
 (stack (colorize "red" (rectangle 50 50))
        (colorize "blue" (circle 25))
        (colorize "green" (rectangle 50 50)))
 (line-up (colorize "orange" (triangle 50))
          (colorize "red" (rectangle 50 50))
          (colorize "blue" (circle 25))
          (colorize "green" (rectangle 50 50))))

;; If you have some time, take a minute and play around a little. Make
;; your own composite shapes, evaluating inner expressions to make
;; sure you know how they fit into the expression containing them.


;;;; Powers of fun

;; What if we want to draw a whole bunch of shapes? Typing "rectangle"
;; over and over again is a chore. We don't have time for that! Our
;; friend the computer wants to help, and it is REALLY GOOD at
;; repetitive chores.

;; Let's start by evaluating this:

(what-is [1 2 3 4])

;; Vectors a great way to write down some things in order. Vectors
;; evaluate to themselves, like strings and numbers do. Try evaluating
;; this one:

[1 2 3 4]

;; Now suppose we wanted a sequence of circles in increasing sizes. We
;; could do something like this:

[(circle 16) (circle 32) (circle 64) (circle 128)]

;; But there's a better way! When we want to call a function on every
;; item in a sequence and get back the results in a new sequence, we
;; can use a special function called `map`:

(map circle [16 32 64 128])

;; What if we wanted purple circles? It would be nice if there was a
;; function to turn a number into a purple circle. Let's make one!

;; Here's a really simple example of a function:

(what-is (fn [n] (circle n)))

;; `(fn [n] (circle n))` means:
;; (1) make a new function that takes a single argument;
;; (2) give that argument the name `n` in expressions within the function;
;; (3) return a circle of radius `n` when this function is called.

;; Try to guess what this expression will return, then evaluate it!

(map (fn [n] (circle n))
     [16 32 64 128])

;; Functions are a bit different to the other expressions that we have
;; been using because we can't evaluate their sub-expressions in
;; place. That's because they need to be called with arguments to know
;; what the value of, for example, `n` is within their expressions.

;; This function just wraps the `circle` function, and so doesn't do
;; anything different than calling circle directly. Boring! But we can
;; change it to also call `colorize` on each circle:

(map (fn [n] (colorize "purple" (circle n)))
     [16 32 64 128])

;; üíú

;; XXX dragons

(doc map)

;; Oof. Maybe that's a bit technical. Let's break it down for what we're doing right now: `map` applies a function to every value in a collection. That means `(map circle [10 20 30])` returns the result of evaluating the function `circle` on the value 10, then on the value 20, then on the value 30: once for each element in the vector.

;; So let's look again at our code from above:

(map circle [2 4 8 16 32 64 128])

;; This returns the result of evaluating `circle` with radius 2, then radius 4, then radius 8, and so on for each number in our vector.


;; XXX NEW
;; Let's try something similar with `rectangle`.

(map rectangle [10 20 5 50 100])

;; Hmm...all squares is fine, but what if we want to draw a city skyline, or a bar chart? We can just give `map` a vector of widths AND a vector of heights, and it will stitch them together for us:

(map rectangle
     [5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]
     [10 20 5 50 100 70 76 33 20 90])

;; Does it annoy you that we had to type out `5` a bunch of times? It annoys me. It's so tedious. Did I even get the number of `5`s right? Thankfully, our friend the computer LOVES doing things over and over, and we can just ask it to `repeat` as many `5`s as we need:

(map rectangle
     (repeat 5)
     [10 20 5 50 100 70 76 33 20 90])

;; How does `repeat` do that?

(doc repeat)

;; Wow. Infinity.üò≤üòØüòµ

;; We can do the same thing with colors: `colorize` takes a color and a shape. That means that if we want to `map` with the `colorize` function, we can give it a vector of colors and then a vector of shapes. Then `map` will execute `colorize` using the first element of each vector, then the second element of each vector, then the third, and so on. So:
(map colorize
     ["red" "blue" "yellow"]
     [(rectangle 20 20) (rectangle 50 50) (rectangle 100 100)])

;; The first element of the first vector and the first element of the second vector get used to call the function. So that expression with `map` is like evaluating each of these individual expressions:

(colorize "red" (rectangle 20 20))
(colorize "blue" (rectangle 50 50))
(colorize "yellow" (rectangle 100 100))


;;;; The power of names

;; Often when programming we need to name something we've created. For instance, we can let the name "palette" be a vector of colors:;; FIXME

(let [palette ["red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "blue" "purple"]]
  (map colorize
       palette
       (repeat (circle 50))))

;; And there's our color palette. Lovely. We can read this as saying, "Let 'palette' be the name for this vector, ['red' 'orange' blah blah blah] while we evaluate the next expression."

;; Names can be helpful, but too many names scattered across our code gets hard to keep track of. That's why we use `let` to create names we only need for right now. Watch--try to use `palette` outside the `let`:

palette

;; The name `palette` only means something *inside the `let`*. That way we know it won't cause trouble somewhere else.

;; If we need a name that we'll use over and over, we need to define it with `def`:
(def palette ["red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "blue" "purple"])

;; Now we can use `palette` anywhere. We can blindly grab a color from our palette with `rand-nth`, which is a random-picker function:
(colorize (rand-nth palette) (circle 50))

;; Let's make a more complex shape with our new color palette.
(apply stack
       (map colorize
            [(rand-nth palette) (rand-nth palette) (rand-nth palette)]
            ;; FIXME requires creating triangle function
            [(circle 50) (triangle 100) (rectangle 100 100)]))

;; It's kind of annoying that we must repeat ourselves for those random colors. And we don't have to! Just like `repeat` will give us as many "nouns" we need, `repeatedly` will give us as many "verby" function calls we need.

(doc repeatedly)

;; So to use `repeatedly`, we need a function. But `(rand-nth palette)` isn't a function, it's a function *call*--it evaluates to some random color name, not the function itself:

(what-is (rand-nth palette))

;; What we need to do is create a function, which we can do `fn`:
(what-is (fn [] (rand-nth palette)))

;; All the functions we've used so far have had names, but this one doesn't, because we're just using it once.

;; Our anonymous function has square brackets to declare its parameters, of which it has none. Now we can call this anonymous function `repeatedly`:
(apply stack
       (map colorize
            (repeatedly (fn [] (rand-nth palette)))
            ;; FIXME requires creating triangle function
            [(circle 50) (triangle 100 100 100) (rectangle 100 100)]))

;; `repeatedly` will go on forever just like `repeat` if we let it, but it knows we only need to call that function as many times as there are shapes. (Clojure is crafty like that.)

;; We can use an infinite number of circles alongside our infinite random color choices, as long as we say how many we want to `take` from the infinite bucket:
(apply line-up
       (map colorize
            (take 10 (repeatedly (fn [] (rand-nth palette))))
            (repeat (circle 50))))

;; You know, we keep using that anonymous function. That's a good sign that maybe we should name it. Just like we named `palette`, we use `def` to name our function:
(def rand-color (fn [] (rand-nth palette)))

;; Now `rand-color` stands shoulder-to-shoulder with `circle` and `map`:
(what-is rand-color)

;; And now it's much more concise to get a random color in our expression:
(apply line-up
       (map colorize
            (take 10 (rand-color))
            (repeat (rectangle 50))))

;; Because we define functions so often, there's a special shorthand for giving them names:
(defn rand-color []
  (rand-nth palette))

;; We use the result of `defn` exactly the same way as the result of `def fn...`:
;; FIXME insert operatic amazing concluding shape here
(apply line-up
       (map colorize
            (take 10 (rand-color))
            (repeat (rectangle 50))))

;; Congratulations! Now that we've created a function, you are a True Programmer. Give yourself a high-five. I am right now giving you a high-five.

;; You've been introduced to the essence of code: writing expressions, asking the computer questions, and creating functions. Where to go with that power is up to you: the next step is finding interesting ways to put functions together to create cool stuff.
